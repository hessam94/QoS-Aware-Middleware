In this research we tried to get an improved QoE estimation for video streaming applications. it is done in few steps:   
1- Subjective test: 20 users are contirbuted in a real subjective test and rated 30 different distorted videos, each one with different distortion rate.  
2- Hybrid mahcine learning training: based on the two network parameter, loss rate and Mean loss burst size, as the input and the acheved scores from subjective test   
as the target, we train a nueral network model. This model can estimate teh QoE(subjective output) beased on the video distortion rate. So we can balance the video resolution based on the network situation in real time.  
3- In the end we improved the Random Nuearl Netwrok algorithm and got better estimation precision.
